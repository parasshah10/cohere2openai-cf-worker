## Special Internet Model

To enable the use of the Internet connector in any chatbot client, we support models with `-internet` in their name. While this is an unofficial feature, it helps reduce additional costs associated with using the Internet connector.

To utilize the Internet connector, simply append `-internet` to the model name. For example, `command-r-plus` would become `command-r-plus-internet`.
